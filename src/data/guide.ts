      'Mentoring is a developmental relationship where a more experienced individual, the mentor, provides guidance, support, and knowledge to a less experienced person, the mentee. The goal is to help the mentee grow personally and professionally by sharing insights, offering advice, and helping navigate challenges. Mentoring can occur in various contexts, such as education, career development, or personal growth. It fosters learning, builds confidence, and accelerates the menteeâ€™s development through constructive feedback and encouragement. A good mentoring relationship is built on trust, communication, and mutual respect.',
